          <strong>This is certainly against the YouTube TOS.</strong> Use at your own risk.

      <p>Get around restricted mode on YouTube!</p>
      <p>If it sees that the video you're trying to watch is restricted it will create a "Watch it anyway" button. Click on that to watch it anyway!</p>
      <p>Due to the way that this has to work, I really would encourage you to try to minimize the times you have to use it.</p>
      <p title="it does">It also might violate the YouTube TOS.</p>
      <p>There might be a 10 second delay before the video starts to show, everything else should be explained in the UI.</p>
