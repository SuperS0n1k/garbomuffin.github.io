    <p>Have you been crying in your sleep since Scratch removed the discuss button? Do you just hate Scratch as a whole now?</p>

    <p>Hi, Billy Mays here for the worlds best userscript ever created, Bring Back Discuss.</p>

    <p>Are you tired of visiting the Scratch home page to find the discuss button missing?</p>

    <p>Well now you can stop being depressed! Just install this userscript and be stunned as the button returns to the home page!</p>

    <p>Look here as I visit the Scratch homepage and the discuss button appears!</p>

    <video src="https://i.imgur.com/kfuPLhy.mp4" controls autoplay muted loop width="75%">Your browser does not support the video element lol.</video>

    <p>No matter how many times you use it, it never breaks!</p>

    <p>
      Imagine all the relief you will feel seeing the Discuss button on the Scratch website.
      Whether you're a <span title="I say this with much regret.">platformerist</span> or a remixer, you deserve the comfort of the discuss button.
