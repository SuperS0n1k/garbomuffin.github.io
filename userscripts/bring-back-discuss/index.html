    <p>Have you been crying in your sleep since Scratch removed the discuss button? Do you just hate Scratch as a whole now?</p>

    <p>Hi, Billy Mays here for the worlds best userscript ever created, Bring Back Discuss.</p>

    <p>Are you tired of visiting the Scratch home page to find the discuss button missing?</p>

    <p>Well now you can stop being depressed! Just install this userscript and be stunned as the button returns to the home page!</p>

    <p>Look here as I visit the Scratch homepage and the discuss button appears!</p>
