    <hr>

    <p>Auto login to the District 112 campus portals!</p>

    <p>
      How does it work? Well when you visit the login page it will see if it has saved your username and password.
      If it doesn't, it asks you for it and saves it for you.
      Then it throws your password and username into the form and clicks submit.
    </p>

    <p>
      It does NOT get stuck in an infinite loop of death if you enter the wrong password.
      It just asks you to reset your information.
      On the old portal it will not click submit if you just signed out of a session. (although it does on the new portal)
    </p>

    <h3><a href="campus-auto-login.user.js">Click here to install it.</a></h3>

    <p>
      It supports both the
      <a href="https://campus.district112.org/campus/portal/isd112.jsp">old</a> and the
      <a href="https://campus.district112.org/campus/portal/students/isd112.jsp">new</a> portals.
    </p>

    <h3>Changelog</h3>
    <p>v2.2: added support for the new portal AND the old. should work as you would expect.</p>

    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>(on school chromebooks) You have to reset your passwords after closing/restarting your browser/chromebook.</li>
    </ul>
