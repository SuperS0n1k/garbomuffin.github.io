    <h1>Campus Auto Login (v3.0)</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>Auto login to the District 112 campus portals!</p>

    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Install <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en">TamperMonkey</a>.</li>
        <li>Click the giant link below and then "Install".</li>
        <li>You're done. It should (in theory?) update automatically.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3><a href="campus-auto-login.user.js">Click here to install it.</a></h3>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter your username and password into the boxes like usual.</li>
        <li>Instead of clicking "Submit", click the "Remember Me" button this has created.</li>
        <li>You're good to go, from now on it will automatically set the fields and click submit.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>It will detect incorrect passwords or captchas and stop submitting and reset passwords. (you will have to tell this to remember them again with the "Remember Me" button)</p>

    <p>
      It supports both the
      <a href="https://campus.district112.org/campus/portal/isd112.jsp">old</a> and the
      <a href="https://campus.district112.org/campus/portal/students/isd112.jsp">new</a> portals
      with support for <a href="https://empower.district112.org">empower</a> planned. (but not in yet)
    </p>

    <h3>Changelog</h3>
    <p class="no-margin">
      <b>v3.0</b>:
      <ul class="no-margin">
        <li>Complete rewrite in typescript instead of javascript. (transpiles to javascript)</li>
        <li>The method of saving passwords has changed. You now enter your passwords into the boxes then click "Remember Me"</li>
        <li>Your passwords should (in theory) be stored between restarts. This is really big.</li>
        <li>You now only need to set your stuff on one version of portal. The credentials are shared.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>v2.2</b>: added support for the new portal AND the old. should work as you would expect.</p>

    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Passwords aren't exactly stored in the most secured way ever, but as long as you aren't an idiot it should be safe.</li>
    </ul>
