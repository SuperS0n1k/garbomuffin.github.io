    <h1>Campus Auto Login (v3.3)</h1>
    <hr>

    <img src="pic.png">

    <p>Auto login to the District 112 campus portal and <a href="#supported">other supported sites</a>!</p>

    <h3>Installation (for Chrome, any platform)</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Install <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en">TamperMonkey</a>.</li>
        <li>Click the button below and then "Install".</li>
        <li>You're done. It will update automatically.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <button onclick="return openScript();"><b>Click here to install it</b> (after reading the above)</button>

    <noscript>Or, since you don't have javascript enabled (why are you using this?), <a href="campus-auto-login.user.js">here's an alternative install link.</a></noscript>

    <!-- if the popup fails or something -->
    <h3 class="no-popup"><a href="campus-auto-login.user.js">Click here to install it.</a></h3>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Visit a <a href="#supported">supported site</a>.</li>
        <li>Enter your username and password into the boxes like usual.</li>
        <li>
          Instead of clicking "Submit", click the "Remember Me" button this has created.<br>
          (it's spot varies for each page, but it's usually near the "Forgot Password" button)
        </li>
        <li>You're good to go, from now on it will automatically set the fields and click submit.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>It will detect incorrect passwords or captchas and stop submitting and reset passwords. (you will have to tell this to remember them again with the "Remember Me" button)</p>

    <p>On some sites it will not resubmit if you have recently logged out, only fill the password boxes.</p>

    <h3>How is this different than a password manager?</h3>
    <!-- fun fact: you can use both (and i do) -->
    <p>This is not a password manager. It is not meant to be a replacement. It can't be a replacement.</p>
    <p>This does not offer critical password manager tools and options, because it is not one.</p>
    <p>This is designed for specific sites and works well with them and has features a password manager might not be able to provide.</p>
    <p>This is lightweight, doesn't require an account, and doesn't store your passwords on the cloud.</p>
    <p>This is free, has no ads, doesn't ask for you to hand over your bank account, and the code is open to all.</p>
    <p>This works in your browser, on any browser, on any device.</p>
