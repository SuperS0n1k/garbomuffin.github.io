# ss-js
Just a simple, poorly coded, and unfinished javascript platformer.  
"Recreation" of another game a friend made on scratch.  
All assets and a large portion of the game logic is borrowed from there.  

[Here's the game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/79038438/)
[and it's creator](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TriforceMayhem/).
