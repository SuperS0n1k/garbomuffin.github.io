<h1>Why pay only 1 sat/byte?</h1>

<p>Because why pay more if its not needed?</p>

<hr>

<p>Obviously if your transaction needs to be in the next block then you'll have to pay a higher fee.</p>
<p>But most transactions that you do day to day aren't that important and you are probably okay with them taking even days to confirm.</p>

<p>The main reason fees are often so high is transaction spam. Here's what I mean:</p>

<p>That sudden gain of almost 14MB of transactions is totally not spam. Definitely organic growth. (/s if it wasn't implied)</p>

<p>You may notice in that chart that the transactions with 20-30 sat/byte fees are starting to get confirmed towards the end.</p>
<p>Given enough time eventually 1 sat/byte transactions will start to get mined again. Just like before the spam.</p>
<p>If you're paying 1 sat/byte you are very well aware of the downsides of this, namely slow confirmation times.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Best case scenario:</h2>
<p>Transaction gets confirmed right away because the mempool is empty.</p>

<h2>Worst case scenario:</h2>
<p>Transaction gets dropped from mempool, you get your coins back.</p>

<p>The average is somewhere in between.</p>

<hr>

<p>Just a reminder: If your transaction doesn't get confirmed after several days you get your coins back.</p>
