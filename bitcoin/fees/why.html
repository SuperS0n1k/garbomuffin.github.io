    <h1>Why pay only 1 sat/byte?</h1>
    
    <p>Because why pay more if its not needed?</p>

    <p>Obviously if your transaction needs to be in the next block then you'll have to pay a higher fee.</p>
    <p>But most transactions that you do day to day aren't that important and you are probably okay with them taking even days to confirm.</p>
    
    <p>The main reason fees are often so high is transaction spam. Here's what I mean:</p>

    <p>Both of those sudden size increases are totally real legitimate transactions. Not spam. (/s if not implied)</p>
    
    <p>After a day, the mempool cleared agian. Low fee transactions are getting confirmed again.</p>

    <h2>Best case scenario:</h2>
    <p>Transaction gets confirmed right away because the mempool is empty.</p>
    
    <h2>Worst case scenario:</h2>
    <p>Transaction gets dropped from mempool, you get your coins back.</p>
    
    <p>The average is somewhere in between.</p>

    <p>Just a reminder: If your transaction doesn't get confirmed after several days you get your coins back.</p>
