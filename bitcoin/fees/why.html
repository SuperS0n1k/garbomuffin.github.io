    <h1>PAY 1 SAT/BYTE</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
      This is the smartest fee choice EVER.

      You pay almost nothing (talking cents, potentially not even plural) and your transaction usually gets confirmed quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sites like <a href="https://bitcoinfees.21.co/">this one</a> and
      <a href="https://btc.com/stats/unconfirmed-tx">this one</a> can recommend really high fees but that's all <s>fake news</s> inaccurate.
    </p>

    <h2>BEST CASE SENARIO:</h2>
    <p>Transaction is confirmed in the next block for almost nothing because the mempool is empty.</p>

    <h2>AVERAGE CASE SENARIO:</h2>
    <p>Transaction takes a couple hours to confirm.</p>

    <h2>WORST CASE SENARIO:</h2>
    <p>
      Transaction gets dropped from the mempool and you get your coins back.
      <b>This is incredibly rare and if you use RBF and increase the fee this should never happen.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Use Replace By Fee</h2>
    <p>
      If your wallet supports it, enable RBF (replace by fee) to be able to increase the fee later if need be.<br>
      This way you can still pay almost nothing in fees under normal conditions and increase the fee if it is absolutedly required or to speed up confirmation time.
    </p>

    <h2>Still don't believe me?</h2>
    <p>
      Here's some transactions I made using low fees.
      The ones that took more than a couple blocks were sent out when the mempool was full or being spammed.

      The <a href="https://blockchain.info/block/000000000000000000aa954522c27be90456c5555981e3d2b2b57cb5975079db">latest block at the time of writing</a>
      contains several cheap transactions. Just scroll down.
    </p>

    <p>If you think those times are steep then consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make your transaction on the weekends. The mempool is emptier.</li>
      <li>Just sleep overnight. (get some sleep, its good for you)</li>
      <li>Use segwit and the lightning network.</li>
    </ul>
