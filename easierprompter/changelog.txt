Easier Prompter Changelog:
(Dates are in MM/DD/YYYY format)

v1.0.1: (2/2/2018)
 * Added new keybind: Hold R to reverse script direction
 * You should use this instead of the "Moving Up/Down" button (which I'm considering removing)

v1.0: One Point Zero (1/20/2018)
 * Finally v1.0
 * Fixed a few grammar/spelling errors
 * Removed some really cringey lines/phrases
 * There will probably be a v1.0.1 in a few days fixing a few bugs

v0.9.9.9.9: (1/18/2018)
 * I'll stop throwing 9s onto the version number. v1.0 is almost here.
 * During lag the script will still move at the same speed
 * "[END]" (customizable) is added to the end of the script and it will stop scrolling when it reaches that point
 * If you enable the unsaved changes warning you will get an alert when you try to leave the site without saving
  * Not enabled by default because I know getting alerts is annoying and saving in this usually isn't very important.

v0.9.9.9: (1/17/2018)
 * Experimenting with service workers
 * Site should now be able to load offline after being loaded once (in modern browsers)
